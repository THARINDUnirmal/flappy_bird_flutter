# 🐤 Flappy Bird Flutter – My First Flutter Game!

Welcome to **Flappy Bird Flutter**, my **first Flutter game development project**, built using **Flutter** and the **Flame Engine**.  
This is a simple and fun Flappy Bird clone that helped me learn game loops, sprites, physics, and collision basics in Flutter.

## 🚀 About the Project
This game is a beginner-friendly 2D endless runner where the player controls a small bird that falls due to gravity.  
Tap the screen to make the bird jump and avoid the pipes as long as possible.

This project helped me learn:
- Game loop basics  
- Flame engine essentials  
- Sprite rendering  
- Gesture handling  
- Physics (gravity & velocity)
